# Address-Book 
Simple application that allows a user to create and query their address books for contacts and friends.

### Prerequisites
- Java 1.8

### Build

mvn clean install

### Implementation details
Implemented the Restful service endpoints as below:
/user
/addressbook/unique/
/addressbook
/adderss
/manage/user

I have tried implementing the controller-service-DAO patternm.Howver I started by choosing to manage the data in the applicaiton rather in a database.
In real implementation I would choose a database to persist the data.
